# Suffix Tree

This repository contains an implementation of a Suffix Tree data structure. The code is written in C++ and provides functionality to build a suffix tree from a given string and perform substring search on the constructed tree.

## Usage

To use the Suffix Tree code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/newYasser/Suffix-Tree.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the code files.

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example:

   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o suffix_tree
   ```

4. Run the executable to execute the program:

   ```
   ./suffix_tree
   ```

The code includes a sample usage scenario in the `main()` function, which demonstrates how to create a suffix tree and perform substring search. You can modify the `main()` function to suit your requirements.
